I am a PhD candidate at PSE working under the supervision of David Margolis and Ariell Reshef. I am interested in trade and labor, especially how firm and workers adapt to trade policy in developing countries. Another part of my recent work addresses the organizational consequences of trade liberalization. Do not hesitate to <a href = mailto:romaine.loubes@psemail.eu></u>write :pen:</a></u> <br> <br>
