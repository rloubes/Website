I am a PhD candidate at PSE working under the supervision of Prs. David Margolis and Ariell Reshef. 
Since 2024, I'm the Coordinator for East and Southern Africa at the <a href= https://inequalitylab.world/en/ ></u> World Inequality Lab</a></u>. 
Since 2025, I'm also Research Fellow at  <a href= https://www.povertyactionlab.org ></u> J-PAL</a></u>, working on the Inclusive Insurance Initiative.
In Winter and Spring 2024, I was visiting the LSE under the supervision of Pr. Rocco Macchiavello and in the fall of 2024 I was visiting UC Berkeley under the supervision of Pr. Muñoz.<br>

I work on **development,** **trade** and **labor economics**. My research revolves around how vulnerable firms and workers manage risks - specifically, on outside employment options and storage constraints as determinants of shock adaptation, and on how the need to manage uncertainty creates interlinks between spouses' jobs and influences structural transformation. <br>
