I am a PhD candidate at PSE working under the supervision of Prs. David Margolis and Ariell Reshef. I am interested in **development,** **trade** and **labor economics**, especially how firm and workers adapt to trade policy in developing countries. Another part of my recent work addresses the organizational consequences of trade liberalization. <br><br>
In Fall 2024, I will be visiting UC Berkeley under the supervision of Pr. Mathilde Mu√±oz. Do not hesitate to <a href = mailto:romaine.loubes@psemail.eu></u>write :pen:</a></u> <br><br>
