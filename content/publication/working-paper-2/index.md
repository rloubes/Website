abstract: In this paper, I show evidence and produce policy recommendations about the impact of child gender on human capital production and parental investments. I adapt a dynamic model of human capital development, allow for gender-specific cognition and health factors, and estimate production and investment functions separately by genders. Although children produce skills very similarly across genders, parental investments are gender-biased in their elasticity to these skills. At an early age, differences in parental investments come from better returns on characteristics for boys, creating scarring effects and eventual skills gender gaps later on.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Does gender inequality in parental investment come from them mis-measuring skills from the same objective measures across genders, or from biased conversion of these skills into investment? I adapt a dynamic model of skill formation and parental investment and show gender bias in parental appreciation of the same factor, with consequences on effective capital formation at later develomment stages.
